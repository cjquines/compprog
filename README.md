My code for competitive programming websites: UVa = [UVa Online Judge](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/), CF = [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/), GCJ = [Google Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam), Euler = [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

I mostly stopped doing programming competitions after graduating from high school, other than GCJ. I might pick it up again.
